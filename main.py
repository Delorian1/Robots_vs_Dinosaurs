# As a developer, I want the battle to conclude once either 
# the robot or the dinosaur has its health points reduced to zero.

# Bonus Points:

# (5 points): As a developer, I want to choose from a List of 3 possible 
# weapons before a robot makes an attack.

# (5 points): As a developer, I want to create Fleet and Herd classes, 
# allowing for a list of 3 Robots to battle against a list of 3 Dinosaurs.
