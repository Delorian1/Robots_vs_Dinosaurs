#(10 points): As a developer, I want a Dinosaur to have a name, health, 
# and attack power.

class Dinosaur:
    def __init__(self, name, attack_power, health):
        self.name = name
        self.attack_power = attack_power
        self.health =  health

    def attack(self, robot):
        self.robot = robot
        pass
